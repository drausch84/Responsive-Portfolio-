                <p>Hello, my name is David Rausch.  I'm an aspiring software developer who is currently enrolled in a coding boot camp through the University of Denver.
                I am also currently a student at Regis University and am about 16 months away from graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
                My previous work experience includes being a C-5 crew chief in the United States Air Force, as well as being a personal trainer, and many jobs within the customer
                service industry.</p>  
                <p>I don't have much work experience in the tech industry, aside from 2 internships, but find that I have the creative mind and discipline to do well.
                This is my personal portfolio site where I will share all of my projects I have worked on, in the hopes to attract the eye of potential employeers.
              </p>
